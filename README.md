A simple extension for [Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time) based on PHP's [Carbon](http://carbon.nesbot.com) library.

__Features:__

* [Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time) is embedded into Carbon (provides access to all of [Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time)'s functionality)
* Supports addition and subtraction of dates
* Provides methods to compare dates
* Supports date formatting in common formats
* Easily calculate difference between dates
* Ease testing with dates by using `carbon.Freeze()` and `carbon.Now()`

__To do:__

* Implement all localization features as in Carbon
* Improve the code style to be more idiomatic Go

## Getting started
Install Carbon:
```
go get github.com/uniplaces/carbon
```

Add to your imports to start using Carbon
```go
import "github.com/uniplaces/carbon"
```

## Examples
A simple example to get you started:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/uniplaces/carbon"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Right now is %s\n", carbon.Now().DateTimeString())

	today, _ := carbon.NowInLocation("America/Vancouver")
	fmt.Printf("Right now in Vancouver is %s\n", today)

	fmt.Printf("Tomorrow is %s\n", carbon.Now().AddDay())
	fmt.Printf("Last week is %s\n", carbon.Now().SubWeek())

	nextOlympics, _ := carbon.CreateFromDate(2016, time.August, 5, "Europe/London")
	nextOlympics = nextOlympics.AddYears(4)
	fmt.Printf("Next olympics are in %d\n", nextOlympics.Year())

	if carbon.Now().IsWeekend() {
		fmt.Printf("Party time!")
	}
}
```
